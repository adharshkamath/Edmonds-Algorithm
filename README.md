# Edmonds-Algorithm <br>

Code for the IT251 project - Implementing Edmonds blossom algorithm <br>

To run the main file:
```
$ cd src
$ pip3 install -r requirements.txt
$ python3 main.py
```
Once the main file is run, a PNG image will be generated and opened, describing the input graph. 

On closing this file, the algorithm will be run and the output graph will be generated and opened as another PNG image. 

The edges in the matching will be colored red.
